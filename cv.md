#### Briefly about myself:

My whole career is connected with a foreign trade (more specifically it's associated with alcohol products). I worked as an import manager for 12 years.
Why i started to study Frontend?
The most important reasons: the profession of the developer gives you the opportunity to create (create some new useful things); IT-sphere allows you to regularly develop and grow professionally; i'm sure, that in this environment i'll strive for maximum professional and personal growth (because i'm used to studying regularly).

#### Basic skills:

- HTML, CSS
- JavaScript Basics
- Git, GitHub
- VS Code

#### Code example:

This is an introductory task with Codewars.  
It's an incorrect code:

`function multiply(a, b){
  a * b
}`

It's the correct code:

`function multiply(a, b){
  return a * b
}`
